# Accounting-_Fraud_ML_prediction
You are asked to develop an ML solution for the accounting fraud problem. You are provided
data assembled from reliable federal sources (e.g., SEC) for publicly traded U.S. firms covering the
period 1990 to 2014. The objective is to minimize the out-of-sample prediction error, considering the
bias-variance trade-offs resulting from using a sample to estimate model parameters. You may consider:
(1) Logistic Regression model, including regularization.
(2) Support Vector Machine.
(3) Other models learned during the course/program.
(4) Ensemble learning.
Predictors available to you are 28 financial indicators taken directly from financial statements
from the companyâ€™s accounting disclosures (see below for data description). Use varied evaluation
metrics, including ROC, AUC, and other metrics (such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-1 score) to
evaluate the performance for prediction and explanation.
